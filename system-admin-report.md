# **System Administration & Maintenance Report for Grade Eleven Explorer**

## 1. Overview  
The **Grade Eleven Explorer** project is a micro SaaS platform aimed at Grade 11 students. It provides an interactive, subject-specific learning experience with quizzes, notes, and resources. The system is built using **Supabase** for database, authentication, and storage, with a focus on real-time data interaction.

---

## 2. Infrastructure Setup  
The infrastructure for **Grade Eleven Explorer** leverages **Supabase**, which handles the core backend services. These include:

- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase, storing user data, notes, and quiz information.  
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth handles user signups, logins, and session management.  
- **Storage**: Files such as PDFs and multimedia content are stored securely using Supabase Storage.  
- **Real-time**: The system uses Supabase's real-time feature to handle live interactions, like quiz feedback and note updates.

---

## 3. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  
For the **CI/CD pipeline**, **GitHub Actions** is integrated to automate deployment to the production environment. This pipeline ensures that:

- Code changes are automatically pushed to the live environment without manual intervention.  
- Tests are conducted on every push to ensure stability.

The integration streamlines updates and reduces manual deployment errors.

---

## 4. Monitoring & Logging  
Currently, the **Grade Eleven Explorer** system uses **Supabase logs** to track database activities and potential errors. While Supabase provides basic logs, there is a planned integration with a 3rd-party monitoring tool like **UptimeRobot** to track uptime and system health.

---

## 5. Backup and Recovery  
To ensure data safety, **Supabase** is set to perform **daily backups** of the entire database. These backups are crucial for restoring the system in case of data loss or corruption. Regular export of critical data to a secure location is also part of the backup strategy.

---

## 6. Error Handling & Alerting  
Error handling and alerting are planned to be integrated using **Supabase** error tracking, along with **GitHub Actions** for deployment failure alerts. Once the monitoring tool is in place, alerts will be sent to a dedicated Slack channel or email for immediate resolution.

---

## 7. Documentation  

### 7.1 Product Documentation  
The **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** outlines the system's features, target users, and success metrics. This document has been completed and provides a clear direction for future development. It includes timelines for milestones and feature releases.

### 7.2 Deployment Documentation  
All system deployments are documented, detailing steps for setting up the environment, handling configurations, and maintaining the database. The CI/CD pipeline is also outlined in the GitHub repositoryâ€™s `README.md` for future developers.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements  
Future improvements include:

- Implementing a more detailed **Monitoring Dashboard** to visualize system performance, user activity, and errors in real-time.  
- Integrating advanced **backup strategies** for more granular data recovery (e.g., weekly snapshot, versioning).  
- Expanding **mobile support** for the platform.

---

### Conclusion  
The **Grade Eleven Explorer** project is nearing completion with a functional backend infrastructure, secure user authentication, and a real-time interactive learning experience. Ongoing maintenance will focus on expanding features and ensuring uptime through monitoring and backup strategies.
