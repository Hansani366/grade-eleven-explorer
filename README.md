üìù System Administration & Maintenance Report
The System Administration & Maintenance Report provides an overview of the DevOps processes and system management for Grade Eleven Explorer. This includes infrastructure setup, CI/CD integration, monitoring, logging, and backup strategies.

Key Highlights:
CI/CD Automation:
GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring automated testing and deployment to production.

Monitoring:
Utilizes Supabase logs to track database activities and error handling. Future integration with third-party monitoring tools (like UptimeRobot) for system health tracking.
